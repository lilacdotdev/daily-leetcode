## üìñ What Is LeetCode? / Why do this Challenge? üìö
$${\color{orange}LeetCode}$$ is a website dedicated to the creation and solving of algorithmically based puzzles.
It utilizes commonly used Data Structures and showcases how to use them to solve puzzles. The skills learned in $${\color{orange}LeetCode}$$ can easily be applied to real life, as they are essentially just training you for knowing when to use them and how to do so through repetition. Thus, I'm setting out on a journey to do **at least 2 months (_60 days_)** of $${\color{orange}LeetCode}$$ daily. All my progress will be uploaded here alongside any notes I've taken, so that I can document my journey and update how I feel after certain intervals!

## ‚è≤Ô∏è Day 0 : Comments ü•ä
Welcome to **Day Zero**! This is the start of my journey! My intent is to weekly give updates in this very readme file on how my progress is going and how I'm feeling about this challenge. For now, I feel pumped! This certainly is not my first time doing LeetCode, so it feels nice to be welcomed back! </br>
<p>Here is a list of my expectations from this challenge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>See improvement within 2 weeks on my accuracy in choosing the correct Data Structure for the job instead of using Arrays permanently</li>
  <li>Learn and document strategies to solve questions more accurately</li>
  <li>Learn more about programming algorithms in languages other than my native Java</li>
  <li>Feel more confident within a month on the accuracy and speed of my algorithms</li>
  <li>Become more comfortable with documentation and whiteboarding techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to my next update with some new additions! Keep you posted!</p>
